# React + TypeScript + Vite + Effect-TS

A minimal playground for exploring **Effect-TS** in a modern **React + TypeScript + Vite** setup.  
Used to experiment with typed effects, functional concurrency, and reactive systems.

## Getting Started

### 3. Run the Effect-TS server
```bash

npm run dev-full
```

### 5. Build and preview
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 6. Useful scripts
